Program timer is now fixed to log timeouts properly

Now contains a more robust logging routine.
Logs to /results/log.txt
	Format:
		Timestamp, IP, ID, START/END, PRACTICE/TEST
logs to /results/grades.txt
	Format:
		Timestamp, IP, ID, PRACTICe/TEST, ALLOCATED TOTAL TIME (MM:SS), ELAPSED TIME (MM:SS), Grade eg 0/100 = 0%

Tested locally and works well with varying times allocated in both practice and test, with submission and timeout.
