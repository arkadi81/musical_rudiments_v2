Upload everything to git,
establish proper version control and ignore list + list of dependencies.

establish gulp/grunt procedure for code streamlining, browsersynced dev, testing, linting, minification.

learn how to create separation between views and information via proper templating
currently the dynamic template dom is created through JS. Is there a way to do this through template without
making further serverside infrastracture (node/etc) necessary? angular? ember? check on that.

lint and clean up theory library for inclusion in further projects.

report structure currently based on bootstrap tables. 
change to rows? ideally generated report should not require dependancy for display.

currently calculation of grade done back end / php.
should the report function calculate the grade, or should this be done on the front end?

add further rhythms, pending dr. clenman.

-------------------------------------------

future project ideas.

expand input using mouse.

build an html form for administrative control of the variables?

incorporate sound?

incorporate new types of questions?
